I made some changes to the folders to better organize the classes. I removed some switches and other unnecessary code that only increased the code and worsened the performance. I also created more methods in some parts to decrease repetition and improve code readability. I've put some parts of the code elsewhere to make it readable. And I refactored some parts of the code to improve the functioning and make it more organized

Examples:
Removing switch of string choice that was repeating code.
Changing vars to specific types to see what type we are declaring.
Changing enums in classes to enum folder for better organization.
Modified Character TakeDamage method to use parameter amount instead of BaseDamage that is not related to the damage we are taking.
